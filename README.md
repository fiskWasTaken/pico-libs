# pico-libs

These .lua files are used in my pico-8 games to aid in development by allowing me to prototype something faster. I try to optimise tokens where possible.

As this repository matures, more of it will look like `ease/`, where libraries are split into multiple files, so a developer only needs to include the functions they need. This is advantageous at .p8.png compile time, since you won't need to delete unused functions from a bigger, more generic include file.
